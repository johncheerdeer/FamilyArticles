                <p> Hello, this is the first article on this website. We are proud to announce this website after all this hard work and dedication. I cant really write much but I could tell you that this website is going to be used to share news to this family. The writer of this right now, john, has coded this entire website on my own and Yianna helped with the colors and design (so far). As we make more articles, we will both write together to make this website active. </p>
